			<p>The International Research Center was established in September 2012, at Beihang University, Beijing, China. The University is committed to building up a world-class research center in data management, and it is ideally situated to do this. Its School of Computer Science and Engineering is one of the top-ranked computer science departments in China, and has traditional strengths in a number of areas.</p>
			<p>The Center focuses on research in connection with management of big data, from theory to practice. Its current research projects include innovative approaches beyond Hadoop to managing big data, data quality -- the other side of big data, querying big social data, and fundamental problems associated with querying big data. It has already established long-term collaborations with several institutions from Europe and North America, notably the <a href="http://wcms.inf.ed.ac.uk/lfcs/" target="_blank">Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science (LFCS)</a> at the University of Edinburgh</a>, and the <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/" target="_blank">Department of Computer and Information Science</a> at the University of Pennsylvania. It has also forged collaborations with several industrial research labs, including Baidu, Tencent . The Center has good resources to support a broad research base in data management. It currently has 8 primary members and several visitors. </p>
			<p>The Center is currently hiring Research Scientists and recruiting PhD students. We invite applicants with a strong background in computer science to contact us. </p>
